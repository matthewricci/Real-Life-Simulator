# Real-Life-Simulator
Real Life Simulator is a VR experience built by Brett Moody, Keanan Pucci, and Matthew Ricci using the Unity development platform.

It is an eclectic combination of fast-paced microgames that get more difficult as you learn to play them. The inspiration for the game comes from WarioWare, where players are required to complete simple tasks at faster and faster speeds, competing with one another for the highest score. We wanted to bring that sense of friendly competition to the VR space with the added background of being inside a glitchy computer system. The microgames you play ask you to perform a variety of tasks that are touted as “normal human behavior” but are actually very odd, such as catching ghosts or juggling eggs. Each only lasts a maximum of ten seconds, providing for a rapidly changing experience for the player. The game also has a high score system that is interactable from the start menu, which players and their friends can use to compete with.

## Build Notes
1.0 - Repo-initializing build that was used as a final class project submission. Game is fully functional with four microgames that are randomly presented to the player. As this is a first full prototype, the artwork is rough and a future art pass is planned to make the visuals more cohesive.
